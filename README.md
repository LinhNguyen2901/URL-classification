# URL Classification for Phishing Detection

A machine learning-based solution to identify and classify potentially malicious phishing URLs.

## Overview

This project implements a URL classification system that helps protect users from phishing attacks by analyzing and classifying URLs as either legitimate or potentially malicious. The system uses machine learning techniques to identify common patterns and characteristics associated with phishing URLs.

## Features

- Real-time URL analysis and classification
- Detection of common phishing patterns and techniques
- Machine learning model trained on extensive phishing and legitimate URL datasets
- Feature extraction from URLs including:
  - Domain characteristics
  - URL structure analysis
  - Special character frequency
  - Length-based features
  - TLD analysis

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/LinhNguyen2901/URL-classification.git

## How It Works

1. *URL Preprocessing*: Extracts and normalizes URL components
2. *Feature Engineering*: Analyzes various URL characteristics
3. *Classification*: Applies trained machine learning model to determine URL legitimacy
4. *Result Output*: Provides classification result with confidence score
